# How to Generate a Mock Server to Test SDKs

When developing SDKs, it's crucial to have a reliable way to test them without depending on live API endpoints. This guide will walk you through the process of generating a mock server using Prism, which can simulate API responses based on your OpenAPI specification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Step 1: Install Prism

First, you'll need to install Prism globally on your system. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your OpenAPI Specification

Ensure you have an up-to-date OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification file for the API you're working with. This file should be in either YAML or JSON format.

## Step 3: Start the Mock Server

To start the mock server, use the following command:

```bash
prism mock path/to/your/openapi-spec.yaml
```

Replace `path/to/your/openapi-spec.yaml` with the actual path to your OpenAPI specification file.

Prism will start a local server, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:4010`.

## Step 4: Configure Your SDK to Use the Mock Server

Update your SDK's configuration to point to the mock server instead of the live API. For example:

```python
client = YourSDKClient(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:4010")
```

## Step 5: Test Your SDK

You can now use your SDK as usual, and it will interact with the mock server instead of the live API. This allows you to test various scenarios without affecting real data or relying on the availability of the actual API.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Examples

Prism uses examples provided in your OpenAPI specification to generate responses. To test specific scenarios, you can add custom examples to your spec file.

### Dynamic Responses

For more complex testing scenarios, you can use Prism's dynamic response generation feature. This allows you to create responses based on request parameters.

### Error Simulation

Prism can simulate various HTTP error codes, allowing you to test how your SDK handles different error scenarios.

## Conclusion

Using a mock server like Prism is an excellent way to ensure your SDK functions correctly across various scenarios. It allows for faster, more reliable testing without the need for constant internet connectivity or concerns about affecting live data.

Remember to keep your OpenAPI specification up-to-date to ensure your mock server accurately reflects the current state of the API.
