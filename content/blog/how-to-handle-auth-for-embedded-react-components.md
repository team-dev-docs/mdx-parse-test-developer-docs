# How to Handle Auth for Embedded React Components

When building React components that will be embedded in other websites, handling authentication can be tricky. Here's a simple approach to manage authentication for embedded React components.

## The Problem

Imagine you're building a React component that needs to make authenticated API calls. This component will be embedded in various websites, and you don't have control over how these sites handle authentication.

## The Solution

1. Create a configuration object that includes auth details.
2. Pass this configuration to your React component.
3. Use the configuration in your API calls.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create a Configuration Object

First, create a configuration object that includes the necessary authentication details. This might look something like this:

```javascript
const config = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  userId: 'user-id',
  // other auth details as needed
};
```

### 2. Pass Configuration to Your React Component

When you render your React component, pass the configuration as a prop:

```html
<div id="react-root"></div>
<script>
  const config = {
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    userId: 'user-id',
  };

  ReactDOM.render(
    <YourComponent config={config} />,
    document.getElementById('react-root')
  );
</script>
```

### 3. Use Configuration in API Calls

In your React component, use the configuration when making API calls:

```javascript
function YourComponent({ config }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${config.apiKey}`,
        'User-ID': config.userId,
      },
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, [config]);

  // Render your component using the data
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Never** include sensitive information like API keys directly in your JavaScript. The configuration should be generated server-side.
- Use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Consider implementing additional security measures like request signing.

## Conclusion

This approach allows you to handle authentication for embedded React components without relying on the host website's authentication system. It's flexible and can be adapted to various authentication schemes.

Remember, the specific implementation will depend on your API's authentication requirements. Always prioritize security when dealing with authentication in client-side code.
