We're excited to announce that Speakeasy has raised a $7M Series A led by Boldstart Ventures! Speakeasy is building a platform that simplifies and accelerates API development through automated documentation, testing, and SDKs.

## The Problem: APIs Are Hard

APIs have become the backbone of modern software development, enabling applications to communicate and share data seamlessly. However, building and maintaining APIs remains a complex and time-consuming process. Developers face numerous challenges:

- Keeping API documentation up-to-date
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different client SDKs
- Managing versioning and backwards compatibility
- Testing API functionality thoroughly
- Handling authentication and security concerns

These pain points slow down development cycles and make it difficult for companies to ship reliable APIs quickly.

## Our Solution: Streamlined API Development

Speakeasy aims to solve these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for API development. Our key features include:

1. **Automated Documentation**: Generate beautiful, always up-to-date API docs from your OpenAPI spec.

2. **SDK Generation**: Automatically create client SDKs in multiple languages to improve developer experience.

3. **API Testing**: Easily create and run tests to validate API functionality and catch regressions.

4. **Version Management**: Track changes and manage multiple API versions with ease.

5. **Authentication & Security**: Built-in support for common auth methods and security best practices.

By automating many of the tedious aspects of API development, Speakeasy allows engineering teams to focus on building great products instead of wrestling with tooling and documentation.

## What's Next

With this new funding, we're excited to expand our team and accelerate product development. We'll be focusing on:

- Enhancing our SDK generation capabilities
- Improving API testing and validation features  
- Building deeper integrations with popular development tools
- Expanding language and framework support

We're also actively hiring across engineering, design, and sales roles. If you're passionate about developer tools and want to help shape the future of API development, [check out our open positions](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/careers).
