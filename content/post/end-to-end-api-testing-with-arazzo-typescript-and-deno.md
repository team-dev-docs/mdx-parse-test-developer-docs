# End-to-End API Testing with Arazzo, TypeScript, and Deno

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a crucial part of ensuring the reliability and functionality of your API. In this article, we'll explore how to perform E2E testing using Arazzo, TypeScript, and Deno.

## What is Arazzo?

Arazzo is a lightweight and flexible E2E testing framework designed specifically for APIs. It allows you to write tests in TypeScript and run them using Deno, providing a seamless and efficient testing experience.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into writing tests, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Deno: [Installation guide](https://deno.land/#installation)
2. Arazzo: Can be imported directly in your test files

## Writing Your First Test

Let's start by writing a simple test for a hypothetical API endpoint. Create a new file called `api.test.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@0.95.0/testing/asserts.ts";
import { Arazzo } from "https://deno.land/x/arazzo@v1.0.0/mod.ts";

const arazzo = new Arazzo("https://api.example.com");

Deno.test("GET /users returns a list of users", async () => {
  const response = await arazzo.get("/users");
  
  assertEquals(response.status, 200);
  assertEquals(response.headers.get("content-type"), "application/json");
  
  const users = await response.json();
  assertEquals(Array.isArray(users), true);
});
```

This test does the following:

1. Sends a GET request to the `/users` endpoint
2. Checks if the response status is 200 (OK)
3. Verifies that the content type is JSON
4. Ensures that the response body is an array of users

## Running Your Tests

To run your tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```
deno test --allow-net api.test.ts
```

The `--allow-net` flag is required to allow network access for API requests.

## Advanced Testing Techniques

### Testing Authentication

Here's an example of how to test an authenticated endpoint:

```typescript
Deno.test("POST /protected-resource requires authentication", async () => {
  const response = await arazzo.post("/protected-resource", {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ data: "example" })
  });
  
  assertEquals(response.status, 200);
});
```

### Testing Error Scenarios

It's important to test how your API handles errors. Here's an example:

```typescript
Deno.test("GET /non-existent-endpoint returns 404", async () => {
  const response = await arazzo.get("/non-existent-endpoint");
  assertEquals(response.status, 404);
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Ensure each test is independent and doesn't rely on the state from other tests.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for your tests to make debugging easier.
3. **Clean Up**: If your tests create data, make sure to clean it up afterwards to prevent test pollution.
4. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables.
5. **Parallel Execution**: Arazzo supports running tests in parallel for faster execution.

## Conclusion

E2E testing with Arazzo, TypeScript, and Deno provides a powerful and efficient way to ensure your API is functioning correctly. By following these practices and examples, you can create a robust test suite for your API.

Remember to keep your tests up to date as your API evolves, and run them regularly as part of your development and deployment processes.
