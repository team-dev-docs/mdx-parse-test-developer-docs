{/*import { Callout } from '~/components'*/}

As we roll into summer, the days are getting longer but your APIs' time to `200` will be getting shorter thanks to our new integration with API documentation providers! More on this exciting new feature below, as well as the regular deluge of updates to our code generator!

Let's get into it 👇

## SDK Docs Integration

Production integration involves a lot more than just making an HTTP request. So why does your API reference have a generic `fetch` call? Authentication, error handling, pagination parsing, request retries, all need to be considered.

Thankfully, SDKs abstract a lot of these concerns for users, making it possible to provide a code snippet that is both concise and useful to your users. And with our new docs integration, it's now possible to automatically update your SDK code snippets with every new version of your SDKs!

Building a production-ready integration is as easy as ⌘C, ⌘V.

import snippets_url from './assets/snippet-docs.mp4';

<div className='mt-10'>
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%" >
    <source src={ snippets_url } type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

Head to [**our docs**](/docs/mintlify) to start integrating SDKs into **your docs**!
