Last week we took a break from our normal changelog schedule. We instead joined Supabase and other outstanding dev tool companies for [​Mega Launch Week​](https://launchweek.dev/lw/2024/MEGA) ⚡ Over the course of 5 days, we launched ​5​ ​new products ​/features for you to get your hands on.

The launch week page can be found [here](/launch-week). Below is the summary for those of you who weren't following along live. If you're interested in any of the features, send us a slack message and we can help you get set up!
