# API Versioning

API versioning is crucial for maintaining backwards compatibility while allowing for future improvements. This document outlines our approach to versioning APIs.

## Versioning Strategy

We use semantic versioning for our APIs. The version number is composed of three parts:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- MAJOR version: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version: Incremented for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- PATCH version: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Version in URL

We include the major version number in the URL to clearly indicate which version of the API is being used:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## Backwards Compatibility

We strive to maintain backwards compatibility within a major version. This means:

- Existing endpoints will not be removed or have their functionality significantly altered
- New endpoints may be added
- Optional parameters may be added to existing endpoints
- The response format may be extended with new fields, but existing fields will not be removed or changed

## Deprecation Policy

When we need to make breaking changes, we will:

1. Introduce a new major version of the API
2. Announce the deprecation of the old version
3. Provide a migration guide for users to update to the new version
4. Support the old version for a minimum of 6 months after deprecation announcement

## Documentation

Each API version has its own documentation. The documentation for a specific version remains unchanged, even as new versions are released.

## Client Libraries

We provide client libraries for popular programming languages. These libraries are versioned to match the API versions they support.

## Testing

We maintain comprehensive test suites for each API version to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
