# Filtering

Filtering is a common operation in APIs, allowing clients to retrieve a subset of resources based on specific criteria. This document outlines best practices for implementing filtering in your API design.

## Basic Filtering

Basic filtering should be implemented using query parameters. Each filterable field should be represented as a separate query parameter.

Example:
```
GET /api/users?status=active&role=admin
```

This request would return all active users with the admin role.

## Advanced Filtering

For more complex filtering needs, consider implementing a query language that allows for more expressive filters.

Example using a hypothetical query language:
```
GET /api/users?filter=status:active AND (role:admin OR role:moderator)
```

## Pagination and Filtering

When implementing filtering, always consider how it interacts with pagination. Filters should be applied before pagination to ensure consistent results.

## Performance Considerations

- Index frequently filtered fields in your database to improve query performance.
- Consider setting limits on the complexity of filters to prevent resource-intensive queries.
- Implement caching strategies for common filter combinations.

## Documentation

Clearly document which fields can be filtered and any limitations on filtering. This helps API consumers use the filtering functionality effectively.

## Validation

Implement robust validation for filter parameters:
- Ensure that filtered fields exist and are allowed to be filtered.
- Validate the format and values of filter parameters.
- Provide clear error messages for invalid filters.

## Partial Matching and Case Sensitivity

Define and document how partial matching and case sensitivity are handled for string filters. For example:
- Case-insensitive: `?name=john` matches "John", "JOHN", "john"
- Partial matching: `?name=joh` matches "John", "Johnson", etc.

## Multiple Values

Allow filtering by multiple values for the same field. This can be implemented using comma-separated values or by repeating the query parameter.

Example:
```
GET /api/products?category=electronics,books
```
or
```
GET /api/products?category=electronics&category=books
```

## Nested Object Filtering

For APIs that return nested objects, consider allowing filtering on nested properties using dot notation.

Example:
```
GET /api/orders?customer.country=USA
```

## Filtering on Relationships

Allow filtering based on related entities. This can be particularly useful in APIs with complex data models.

Example:
```
GET /api/books?author.name=Jane Austen
```

## Null and Empty Values

Define how to filter for null or empty values. For example:
```
GET /api/users?email=null
```
might return users with no email address.

## Date Range Filtering

For date fields, consider implementing range-based filtering.

Example:
```
GET /api/orders?created_at.gte=2023-01-01&created_at.lte=2023-12-31
```

## Combining Filtering with Other Query Parameters

Ensure that filtering works well with other query parameters such as sorting, pagination, and field selection.

Example:
```
GET /api/users?role=admin&sort=last_login:desc&page=2&fields=id,name,email
```

## Escaping Special Characters

Provide a mechanism for escaping special characters in filter values, especially if implementing a query language for advanced filtering.

## Preemptive Filtering

Where possible, design your API to preemptively filter out data that the user should not have access to, based on their authentication and authorization level.

## Consistency

Maintain consistency in your filtering implementation across different endpoints and resources in your API.

Remember, the specific implementation details may vary based on your API's requirements, the backend technology stack, and the needs of your API consumers. Always test thoroughly and gather feedback from API users to refine and improve your filtering functionality.
