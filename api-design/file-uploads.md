# File Upload API Design

This document outlines the design for file upload functionality in our API.

## Overview

The file upload API allows clients to upload files to our server securely and efficiently. It supports both single and multiple file uploads, as well as large file uploads through chunked transfer.

## Endpoints

### Single File Upload
`POST /api/v1/upload`

### Multiple File Upload
`POST /api/v1/upload/multiple`

### Chunked File Upload
`POST /api/v1/upload/chunked`

## Request Format

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- File field name: `file` (for single uploads) or `files[]` (for multiple uploads)

## Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileId": "1234567890abcdef",
  "fileName": "example.jpg",
  "fileSize": 1048576,
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

## Error Handling

In case of errors, the API will return appropriate HTTP status codes along with error messages in the response body.

## Large File Uploads

For large files, we recommend using the chunked upload endpoint. This allows for resumable uploads in case of intermittent network issues.

## Security Considerations

- File size limits are enforced to prevent abuse
- File types are validated to ensure only allowed file types are uploaded
- Authentication and authorization are required for all upload endpoints

## Performance Optimization

- Use of cloud storage for scalability
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed files
- Consider using a CDN for faster file delivery

## Monitoring and Logging

All file upload activities are logged for auditing purposes. Monitoring is in place to track upload success rates and identify potential issues.

## Future Improvements

- Implement direct-to-S3 uploads for improved performance
- Add support for file versioning
- Integrate with virus scanning services for enhanced security
