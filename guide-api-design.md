## Introduction

Designing a clear, consistent, and user-friendly API is crucial for the success of our services. This guide will help you create APIs that are easy to use, maintain, and scale.

## RESTful Design Principles

Follow these RESTful design principles:

- Use nouns, not verbs, in endpoint paths
- Use logical nesting for resources
- Use HTTP methods appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Use plural nouns for collection endpoints

> **Example:**
> 
> GET /api/v1/users
> POST /api/v1/users
> GET /api/v1/users/{id}
> PUT /api/v1/users/{id}
> DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}

## Versioning

Always version your APIs to ensure backward compatibility:

- Include the version in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/resource)
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

## Error Handling

Implement consistent error handling:

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide clear error messages in the response body
- Include an error code for easier troubleshooting

> **Example error response:**
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "error": {
>     "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
>     "message": "The provided email address is not valid."
>   }
> }
> ```

## Security

Implement these security measures:

- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize all input
- Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse

## Documentation

Provide comprehensive documentation for your API:

- Use OpenAPI (Swagger) specification
- Include example requests and responses
- Explain all parameters, headers, and response fields
- Keep documentation up-to-date with each API change

Remember, good API design leads to better developer experience and increased adoption of your services.
