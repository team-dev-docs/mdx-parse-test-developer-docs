# API Experts: APIs that Build APIs

At Anthropic, we're passionate about building powerful yet accessible AI systems. Our API Experts product aims to bring that same philosophy to API development - allowing developers to rapidly prototype and iterate on API designs using natural language.

## Key Features

- Natural language API specification: Describe your desired API in plain English
- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger generation
- Rigorous type checking and validation
- Mock server generation for rapid prototyping  
- Integration with popular API gateways and platforms

## How It Works

1. Provide a high-level description of your desired API functionality
2. Our AI models interpret your description and generate a formal API specification
3. Iteratively refine the spec through natural language conversation
4. Export OpenAPI/Swagger docs, mock servers, and other artifacts

## Benefits

- Dramatically accelerate API design and prototyping
- Ensure API best practices and standards compliance 
- Reduce cognitive load of translating ideas into formal specs
- Achieve feature parity faster across multiple platforms
