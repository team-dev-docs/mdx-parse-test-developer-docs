# Types

## Type naming

Speakeasy tries to name your types using the shortest name possible, which is achieved by deducing a name from its surrounding context.

Types defined using components generally result in better type names. Where possible, Speakeasy uses the component's key name as the type name.

For example, given the following schema:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
```

The type name for the `User` schema will be `User` where possible. If a conflict arises with another type in the same namespace, name resolution will kick in: The earliest encountered type will be named `User` and types encountered subsequently will have prefixes or suffixes added to the name based on context to avoid conflicts.

If a component name is unavailable (for example, the type is defined inline in a schema, request, response, or parameter), Speakeasy will determine the type name based on context in the following order:

- The `x-speakeasy-name-override` extension value in the schema
- The `title` property in the schema
- The `$anchor` property in the schema
- Any other context of the schema

Types that are named this way are `objects` that become classes, `integer` and `string` types that have `enum` values defined in the schema, or `oneOf` or `anyOf` schemas that become union types.

Inline schemas are more likely to have name conflicts with other types, which can result in context-based prefixes or suffixes being added to type names until the conflict is resolved. For example:

```yaml
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      operationId: getUsers
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object # inline schema that will be named based on surrounding context
                  title: User
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: string
                    name:
                      type: string
  /user:
    get:
      operationId: getUser
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: object # inline scheme that will be named based on surrounding context
                title: User
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: string
                  name:
                    type: string
```

Here, both inline schemas are candidates for the name `User`. As there will be a conflict (Speakeasy doesn't perform any inference to assess whether the schemas are the same type), the second schema will be given a name with a context-based prefix to avoid a conflict with the first schema.

Some of the context prefixes and suffixes that can be added to type names are:

- Reference type
- Reference name
- Property name
- Operation name
- Tag name
- Request
- Response
- Position in `oneOf` or `anyOf` schema

Should Speakeasy run out of context to use in naming the type, it will add numbers to type names as suffixes.

To avoid unexpected type names and ensure you get the names you expect, use unique component names for your schemas wherever possible.

## Input and output models

Speakeasy will generate separate input and output models for schemas that are used in both request and response bodies and define `readOnly` and `writeOnly` flags in their properties.

For example, given the following schema:

```yaml
paths:
  /drinks/{id}:
    post:
      operationId: updateDrink
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Drink'
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Drink'
components:
  schemas:
    Drink:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          readOnly: true
        stockUpdate:
          type: integer
          writeOnly: true
        name:
          type: string
        category:
          type: string
        stock:
          type: integer
          readOnly: true
```

The `Drink` component is used both as a request body and response body schema, but it uses fields that can only be set when updating the drink and read when getting the returned drink.

In this case, Speakeasy will generate two models `DrinkInput` and `DrinkOutput`.

The `DrinkInput` model will have the following properties:
  - stockUpdate
  - name
  - category

The `DrinkOutput` model will have the following properties:
  - id
  - name
  - category
  - stock

If a schema has only `readOnly` flags and no `writeOnly` flags or vice versa, Speakeasy will still generate two models if used in both request and response bodies, but the `Input` or `Output` schema will be added only to the relevant models based on the flags.

The `Input` and `Output` suffixes can be reconfigured using the `inputModelSuffix` and `outputModelSuffix` options in the `gen.yaml` file. See the [gen.yaml reference](/docs/gen-reference) for more infomation.

## Handling constants and defaults

If a schema has a `const` or `default` value defined in it, Speakeasy will generate code to handle these wherever possible.

### `const`

Using `const` allows you to specify a value that must be transmitted to the server and is always expected to be received from the server.

For example:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Drink:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          const: 'drink'
```

The `type` property has a `const` value of `drink`, so the SDK will be generated with this field as non-configurable, as the value `drink` will always be transmitted. A `const` getter will be generated to access the value if required.

### `default`

Default values allow you to specify a value to be transmitted to the server if none is provided by the end user.

For example:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Drink:
      type: object
      properties:
        category:
          type: string
          default: 'spirits'
      required:
        - category
```

The `category` property has a default of `spirits`. Although `category` is marked as `required`, the SDK will be generated with this field set to optional, and the value `spirits` will be transmitted if no other value is provided by the end user.


## Examples

If a type includes an `example` or `examples` field, Speakeasy will use the values (if valid for the defined schema) to populate usage snippets in the generated SDKs.

If more than one example is provided in the `examples` field, a random example will be chosen.

## Including Unused Schema Components

When working with OpenAPI specifications, there might be cases where you want to include schema components in your generated SDKs even if they aren't directly referenced by any API endpoints. This is particularly useful for:

- Webhook payload types in OpenAPI versions below 3.1 (before webhooks were officially supported)
- Types that are used in async operations or events
- Shared types that might be used in future endpoints

### Using x-speakeasy-include

To include an unused schema component in your generated SDK, add the `x-speakeasy-include: true` extension to the schema component definition:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    WebhookPayload:
      x-speakeasy-include: true  # This schema will be included in the SDK even if unused
      type: object
      properties:
        event_type:
          type: string
        data:
          type: object
```

### Important Notes

- This extension only works in the main OpenAPI document. It is not supported in referenced documents (e.g., components in separate files).
- The schema will be included in your SDK regardless of whether it's referenced by any endpoints.
- This is particularly useful for webhook payloads in OpenAPI versions before 3.1, where webhook support wasn't built into the specification.
