# Configuring Module Format

Modern SDKs need to balance compatibility with performance. The `moduleFormat` option in the SDK generator allows developers to control whether an SDK is built for CommonJS (CJS), ECMAScript Modules (ESM), or both. This choice impacts bundle size, tree-shaking performance, and compatibility with Node.js and modern bundlers.

## How to Configure Module Format

To configure the module format, update `gen.yaml` (which is often located in the SDK’s `.speakeasy` directory) file under the `typescript` section:

```yaml <sdk-root>/.speakeasy/gen.yaml
typescript:
  # add or modify `moduleFormat`
  moduleFormat: "commonjs" # or "esm" or "dual"
  # other Typescript configuration options...
```

### Supported Options

- **`"commonjs"` (default)**: Builds SDK for CommonJS. Widely supported across Node.js environments but less optimized for modern bundlers and tree-shaking.
- **`"esm"`**: Builds SDK for ECMAScript Modules, the modern standard for JavaScript modules. Provides optimal tree-shaking and significantly smaller bundles when used with bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite.
- **`"dual"`**: Builds SDK for both CJS and ESM formats. Provides the best of both worlds - ESM's superior tree-shaking and bundle optimization while maintaining compatibility with older CommonJS environments. The slight build time increase is often worth the flexibility and performance benefits.

## Module Format Overview

`moduleFormat` determines the module system targeted during SDK build. It impacts:

- Node.js project compatibility,
- Bundler tree-shaking capabilities,
- SDK bundle size, and
- Build performance.

### Example Outputs for Each Option

#### CommonJS (Default)

When configured with `commonjs`:

```javascript example.js
// CommonJS import in consumer code
const { ApiError } = require("petstore/errors/apierror.js");

// ESM import (interop code included)
import { ApiError } from "petstore/errors/apierror.js";
```

#### ESM

When configured with `esm`:

```javascript example.js
// Native ESM import in consumer code
import { ApiError } from "petstore/errors/apierror.js";

// ❌ Will not work in CommonJS-only environments
```

#### Dual

When configured with `dual`:

```javascript example.js
// ESM import (no interop code)
import { ApiError } from "petstore/errors/apierror.js";

// CommonJS import (still works seamlessly)
const { ApiError } = require("petstore/errors/apierror.js");
```

## How to Decide Which Format to Use

**Use CommonJS (`commonjs`) if...**

- The SDK is used primarily in Node.js environments or older projects.
- Bundle size optimization is not a critical requirement.
- You need maximum compatibility with legacy systems.

**Use ESM (`esm`) if...**

- SDK consumers use modern bundlers like Vite, Webpack, or Rollup.
- Tree-shaking and bundle size optimization are top priorities.
- Your project is already using ESM throughout.
- You want to leverage the latest JavaScript features and tooling.

**Use Dual Mode (`dual`) if...**

- You need to support both modern and legacy environments.
- You want ESM's superior tree-shaking while maintaining CommonJS compatibility.
- Your SDK will be used in diverse environments with different module requirements.
- You prioritize developer experience and want to provide maximum flexibility.

For most modern projects, we recommend using `dual` format. This ensures your SDK works seamlessly in any environment while still providing the performance benefits of ESM when used with modern bundlers.
