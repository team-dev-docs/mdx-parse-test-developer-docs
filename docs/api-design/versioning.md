# API Versioning

API versioning is crucial for maintaining compatibility with existing clients while allowing for future improvements and changes.

## Versioning Strategy

We use semantic versioning (SemVer) for our API. The version number is in the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

> Major version changes indicate breaking changes.
> Minor version changes add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
> Patch version changes make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Version in URL

We include the major version number in the URL to clearly indicate which version of the API is being used:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## Backwards Compatibility

We strive to maintain backwards compatibility within a major version. When introducing new features or changes, we follow these guidelines:

1. Add new endpoints or parameters without modifying existing ones.
2. Deprecate old endpoints or parameters before removing them.
3. Provide clear documentation on any changes or deprecations.

## Deprecation Policy

When deprecating an endpoint or feature:

1. We announce the deprecation in our changelog and documentation.
2. We provide a timeline for when the deprecated feature will be removed.
3. We offer guidance on migrating to new endpoints or features.

## Version Lifecycle

Each major version of the API goes through the following lifecycle:

1. **Active**: Fully supported and receiving updates.
2. **Maintenance**: Only critical bug fixes and security updates.
3. **Deprecated**: No further updates, with a timeline for removal.
4. **Sunset**: Removed from service.

We typically support at least two major versions concurrently to allow time for clients to migrate.

## Communication

We communicate version changes and updates through:

- Our API changelog
- Developer newsletters
- In-app notifications for breaking changes

By following these versioning practices, we aim to provide a stable and reliable API for our developers while allowing for continuous improvement and innovation.
