# Schema Keywords

<Callout title="Tip" variant="success">
This section is not an exhaustive list of available keyword options. If you&apos;re unsure whether a keyword is supported, please reach out to our team at support@speakeasy.com.

### The `anyOf` Keyword

Terraform has limited support for the `anyOf` keyword due to its less flexible type system than JSON Schema. For instance, managing `anyOf` with multiple subtypes requires a large set of combined types, leading to practical and implementation challenges.

Consider replacing `anyOf` in your schema with `oneOf` or `allOf`. This adjustment aligns with Terraform's capabilities: `oneOf` for union types and `allOf` for intersection types.

For more guidance or to discuss schema adaptations, contact our support team at support@speakeasy.com.

### The `oneOf` Keyword

In Terraform, `oneOf` is defined as a `SingleNestedAttribute` where each potential child is represented by a unique key. To ensure compliance with `oneOf` semantics, `conflicts-with` plan validators are added to confirm that only one of these keys is active at any given time.

If a `oneOf` is declared at the root level of an entity, the Speakeasy generator will extract common property attributes and duplicate them into the root level. This is important if, for instance, a common `id` property is required for making read, update, or delete requests.

### The `allOf` Keyword

For `allOf`, Speakeasy merges all sub-schemas into a single combined attribute, creating a unified schema component that encapsulates all specified properties.
