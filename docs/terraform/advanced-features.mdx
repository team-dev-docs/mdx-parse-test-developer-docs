# Advanced Features

## Speciality Annotations

The annotations in this section are not commonly used within Speakeasy. We recommend contacting our team to help determine if they are correct for you.

### Force Mark Property as Read-Only

The `x-speakeasy-param-readonly` extension marks a property as read-only. Any user attempt to modify it in Terraform will result in a runtime error. This prevents unintended changes to critical properties in Terraform configurations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-readonly: true
```

### Force Designate a Property as Optional

Apply `x-speakeasy-param-optional` to any property to designate it as optional. This extension takes precedence over the required attribute in the JSON Schema specification, providing flexibility in Terraform configurations by allowing optional settings for certain properties.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-optional: true
```

### Force Resource Recreation on Property Change

Properties marked with `x-speakeasy-param-force-new` will cause the associated Terraform resource to be destroyed and recreated whenever the property value changes. This ensures that any alteration to the property triggers a complete recreation of the object.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-force-new: true
```

### Update Behavior for Plan-Only Attributes

The `x-speakeasy-terraform-plan-only` extension ensures that only the values from the Terraform plan are used during updates, overriding any prior state or default values provided by the API. By preventing prior state values from being merged into the update request, the annotation ensures that omitted or null values in the plan are correctly reflected in API calls.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          x-speakeasy-terraform-plan-only: true
```
