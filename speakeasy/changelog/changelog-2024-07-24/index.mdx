Generation targets grow up so fast. You announce their alpha release, and before you know it, they're off to beta... And it's not only the Python Generator that's maturing.

The Mintlify integration is now self-serve, and Terraform Generation just got even more fully featured with the addition of OpenAPI-based Plan Validators.

Read on for the details!

## Mintlify Integration - Now Self-Serve

<div className="mt-10">
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%">
    <source src={mintlify_setup} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

Making your API documentation SDK-based is easier than ever with our Mintlify integration now available for self-serve.

1. Select the SDKs you want to include in your docs.
2. Point Speakeasy workflow at your Mintlify repo.

That's it! Now every new generation of your SDKs will automatically update your Mintlify repo.

## Terraform Plan Validators

```go
func (r *userResource) Schema(_ context.Context,
_ resource.SchemaRequest, resp *resource.SchemaResponse) {
  resp.Schema = schema.Schema{
    Attributes: map[string]schema.Attribute{
      "username": stringattribute.String{
        Required:    true,
        Description: "The username of the user.",
        Validators: []validator.String{
          stringvalidator.LengthBetween(6, 64),
          stringvalidator.RegexMatches(
            regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-z]+$`),
            "must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters",
          ),
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
```

With the latest Speakeasy release, Terraform Provider generation will now automatically convert additional OAS validation properties into Terraform configuration validators. This will ensure that Terraform users will receive upfront feedback about invalid configurations before they are applied.

Automatic OAS -> Terraform validation now includes:

- For `string` types: `​maxLength​`, `​minLength​`, and `​pattern`
- For `integer` types: `​maximum​` and `​minimum`
- For `array` types: `​maxItems​`, `​minItems​`, and `​uniqueItems`

Refer to [the docs](/docs/terraform/extensions#configuration-validation) for more on validation capabilities.

## Python Beta Release: Pydantic & Async

<div className="mt-10">
  <video controls={false} loop={true} autoPlay={true} width="100%">
    <source src={beezy_ide_video} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>

Last changelog we announced the alpha release of our new Python Generator with support for Async & Pydantic models. We're now excited to announce the new generator is in beta!

All new SDKs will use the new generator by default. Existing production SDKs will be migrated by request.

For all the details on the new generator, read about [our Python SDK design](/docs/sdk-design/python/methodology-python)
