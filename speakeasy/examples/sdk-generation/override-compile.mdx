## Overriding Compile Commands for SDK Generation

### 1. Remove `package.json` from `.genignore`

The `.genignore` file is used to signal which files are manually managed rather than handled by the SDK generator. It functions similarly to `.gitignore` but for SDK generation purposes. 
Update your `.genignore` file to remove `package.json`. It no longer needs to be ignored as the generation process will manage it automatically.

### 2. Create a Compile Script

Create a file named `openapi/scripts/compile.sh` and add the following script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

npm install
npm run build
```

Ensure the script is executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x openapi/scripts/compile.sh
```

### 3. Update `gen.yaml`

Modify your `.speakeasy/gen.yaml` file to include the `compileCommand` under the TypeScript section. Add the following configuration:

```yaml
typescript:
  compileCommand:
    - bash
    - -c
    - ./openapi/scripts/compile.sh
```

### 4. Verify the Configuration

Run the following command to test that the setup is working as expected:

```bash
speakeasy run --force
```
