# How Speakeasy Supports Our Enterprise Customers

## 1. Automatic SDK Maintenance

A core aspect of Speakeasy's value proposition is keeping your SDKs up to date with key changes in languages, frameworks, and dependencies.

We ensure that these updates are propagated to the SDKs we maintain on your behalf, and post such updates automatically in the SDK pull requests we create.

<div className="Callout" data-title="Note" data-variant="info">
  We recommend upgrading to the newest version of Speakeasy to ensure your SDKs benefit from the latest updates. Customers using Speakeasy via GitHub Actions will automatically use the most recent version.
</div>


## 2. Support SLAs

Speakeasy is committed to providing rapid response and resolution to any issues you raise. With this in mind, we offer:
* A dedicated customer support channel (Slack, Teams).
* Prioritized ticket resolution based on severity (P0, P1, P2 SLAs).
* SLAs for question response and ticket triage are detailed below.

| Priority level | Definition | SLA | Initiation | Credits |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| P0 | Generated Terraform providers or SDKs do not work (severe functional issues) | First response within 1 hour | E-mail support@speakeasy.com | 5% of the fee applicable in the month per incident of SLA breach |
| P1 | Generated Terraform providers or SDKs have severe ergonomic or minor functional impact on customers | First response within 3 hours | E-mail support@speakeasy.com | 2% of the fee applicable in the month per incident of SLA breach |
| P2 | Generated Terraform providers or SDKs have bugs with minor ergonomic impact on customers, feature requests | Prioritize as part of standard Speakeasy development practice, visible in public roadmap | E-mail support@speakeasy.com | n/a |


## 3. Uptime SLAs

Core systems (code generation, app, CLI) uptime: 99.99% uptime per calendar month
- Calculation: Total uptime minutes per calendar month / total minutes per calendar month
- Credit on SLA breach:
  - Uptime between 95% - 99.99%: 10% of the fee applicable in that month
  - Uptime less than 95%: 20% of the fee applicable in that month

Current and historical metrics can be viewed at https://status.speakeasyapi.dev/.

In no instance will the total credits in a given month for Technical Support SLA breaches or Uptime SLA breaches exceed the total fee applicable from the customer in that month.
