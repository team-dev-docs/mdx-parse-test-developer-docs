#  Map API Entities to Terraform Resources

Add the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation to objects in your OpenAPI spec to include them as entities in the Terraform provider.

As a component:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Order:
      description: An order helps you make coffee
      x-speakeasy-entity: Order
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          description: Numeric identifier of the order.
        name:
          type: string
          description: Product name of the coffee.
        price:
          type: number
          description: Suggested cost of the coffee.
      required:
        - name
        - price
      type: object
```

Or inline in a path:

```yaml
paths:
  /order:
    post:
      tags:
        - Order
      summary: Create a coffee order
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Order#create
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              x-speakeasy-entity: Order
              properties:
                id:
                  type: integer
                  description: Numeric identifier of the order.
                name:
                  type: string
                  description: Product name of the coffee.
                price:
                  type: number
                  description: Suggested cost of the coffee.
              required:
                - name
                - price
              type: object
```

```tf
resource "yourprovider_order" "example" {
  name = "Filter Blend"
  price = 11.5
}
```

Where you place the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation affects the Terraform provider structure.
- **At the top level:** Properties are nested objects.
- **At a lower level:** Properties above the annotation are flattened.


**Top Level** 
```yaml 
Pet:
  x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
  ...
```


```tf
resource "yourprovider_pet" "example" {
  data = { name = "Filter Blend" }
}
```

**Lower Level**
```yaml 
Pet:
  properties:
    data:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      ...
```


```tf
resource "yourprovider_pet" "example" {
  name = "Filter Blend"
}
```

<Callout title="Warning" variant="warning">
Properties above the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation are flattened, which could cause conflicts. Apply the annotation carefully to align the structure of the Terraform provider with your API&apos;s intended user interaction.
</Callout>


## Specify CRUD Operations for API Endpoints

The `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation specifies CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations associated with each endpoint in your OpenAPI spec for a Terraform entity. The value determines the behavior of operations such as create, read, update, and delete and is structured as `Entity#operation,operation,...#order`:
  - `Entity` represents the name of the entity.
  - `operation` can be one or more of `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, concatenated with commas.
  - `order` is optional and can be used to define additional API calls that should be invoked for a given CRUD invocation.

### Behavior of Operations

- `Entity:create` makes the entity a Terraform resource.
- `Entity:read` ensures consistency with Terraform state, updates attributes, and generates a data source.
- `Entity:update` provides update support for the resource. Without it, any attribute change requires resource replacement (`ForceNew`).
- `Entity:delete` enables deletion of the resource. Without it, no action is taken on deletion.
- `Entity:create,update` **(idempotent operations)** indicates the API is idempotent. Combine these operations to allow the same API call to create new objects and update existing ones, depending on attribute changes.

```yaml
paths:
  /pet:
    post:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Add a new pet to the store
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#create
  /pet/{petId}:
    get:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Info for a specific pet
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read
    update:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Update the pet
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#update
    delete:
      tags:
        - pet
      summary: Delete the pet 
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#delete
```

### Multiple API Operations for One Resource

When multiple API operations are necessary for a single resource, use the additional entity-ordering capabilities of the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation.

```yaml
paths:
  /pet/{petId}:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read#1
  /animal:
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#read#2
```

Multiple API operations for one resource can be combined with multiple entity operations of [one API operation for multiple resources](#one-api-operation-for-multiple-resources) as necessary.

### One API Operation for Multiple Resources

When a single API operation is necessary for multiple resources, use multiple entity operation entries with the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation.

```yaml
parameters:
  - in: query
    name: id
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
operationId: GetAnimal
x-speakeasy-entity-operation:
  - Cat#read
  - Dog#read
```

One API operation for multiple resources can be combined with the entity operation ordering of [multiple API operations for one resource](#multiple-api-operations-for-one-resource) as necessary.

### Manual association between Operations and Resource / Data Sources

The default behavior within Speakeasy is to automatically infer a data source from all operations that have an `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Entity#read` association defined.

For some APIs, you might want the data source to use a "search" endpoint (e.g., search for an entity by name, where name is non-unique), while using a "get" operation for the resource (e.g., to find an entity by ID for state reconciliation).

In this case, you can use an object syntax for the `x-speakeasy-entity-operation` annotation to explicitly control whether an operation generates a resource, a data source, or both:

```yaml
paths:
  "/example":
    get:
      operationId: getThing
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation:
        terraform-datasource: null
        terraform-resource: Thing#read
```

This syntax allows you to:
- Prevent automatic generation of a data source by setting `terraform-datasource` to `null`
- Prevent invocation of the operation during the resource's Read method ("invoked as part of terraform state refresh") by setting `terraform-resource` to `null`

For example, the configuration above declares that `getThing` is associated with just a resource, and a data source should not be automatically generated.

### Resources with Soft Delete

By default, a generated managed resource uses the HTTP 404 Not Found status code on read to automatically remove the resource from the Terraform state which causes the next Terraform plan to propose recreating the resource. For resource APIs that support soft delete (grace time period before the resource is fully deleted), the `x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property` annotation adds a check against a read response property to also propose resource recreation.

For managed resources, any `x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property` attribute is omitted from the schema and state. For data resources, the attribute remains to preserve client-side filtering capabilities.

In this example, the resource will be proposed for recreation if the `deleted_at` property has a value:

```yaml
paths:
  "/example":
    get:
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Example#read
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schema/ExampleGetResponse"
components:
  schemas:
    ExampleGetResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        # ...
        deleted_at:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          x-speakeasy-soft-delete-property: true
```

## Remap API Property to Terraform Attribute Name

The `x-speakeasy-name-override` annotation adjusts the Terraform attribute name within a resource while remapping all the API data handling internally. This is useful, for example, to standardize differing API property names across operations to a single attribute name.

```yaml
unique_id:
  type: string
  x-speakeasy-name-override: id
```

The annotation also has other [SDK customization capabilities](/docs/customize-sdks/methods), however, those are generally unnecessary for Terraform providers as the generated Go SDK is internal to the provider code.

## Align API Parameter With Terraform Property

The `x-speakeasy-match` annotation adjusts the API parameter name to align with a Terraform state property. If mismatches occur, a generation error will highlight appropriate root-level properties for accurate mapping.


```yaml
paths:
  /pet/{petId}:
    delete:
      parameters:
        - name: petId
          x-speakeasy-match: id
      x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#delete
```

##  Hide Sensitive Properties


Properties marked as `x-speakeasy-param-sensitive` will be concealed from the console output of Terraform. This helps to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data within Terraform operations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        secret:
          type: string
          x-speakeasy-param-sensitive: true
```

## Exclude Property From Terraform State

When `x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true`, this extension ensures the specified property and any interactions involving it are omitted from Terraform's state management.

<Callout title="Info" variant="info">
This extension completely suppresses the property from the Terraform state. If you want to suppress a specific operation, use `x-speakeasy-ignore: true` to omit the operation from the annotated CRUD method. For example, if a field is present in both the `CREATE` and `READ` response bodies, omitting it from the `READ` response body will turn off drift detection for that field. The field will remain in the `CREATE` response body and the Terraform state.
</Callout>

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        optionalMetadata:
          x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true
          type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```tf
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  # Attempting to set an ignored parameter results in an error  
  # optionalMetadata = true
}
```

##  Allow JSON String Attributes

Set the `x-speakeasy-type-override` extension to `any` to convert the associated attribute to a JSON string. This allows for inline the specification of the attribute's value, accommodating attributes with variable or dynamic structures.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        deep:
          x-speakeasy-type-override: any
          type: object
          properties:
            object: 
              type: object
              additionalProperties: true
              properties: 
                in:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    here:
                      type: string
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - name
```

```tf
resource "petstore_pet" "mypet" {
  name = "myPet"
  deep = jsonencode({
    object = {
      with = "anything"
      defined = true
    }
  })
}
```

## Suppress Unnecessary Plan Changes

Setting the `x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff` to true suppresses unnecessary Terraform plan changes for computed attributes that are not definitively known until after application. This is useful in scenarios where computed attributes frequently cause spurious plan changes.


```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        status:
          x-speakeasy-param-suppress-computed-diff: true
          type: string
```


<Callout title="Warning" variant="warning">
Applying this modifier when `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: my_resource#read` is not defined may result in drift between the Terraform plan and remote state should updates to attributes happen outside of Terraform changes. Please only apply this when necessary.
</Callout>

##  Prevent Conflicting Attributes

The `x-speakeasy-conflicts-with` extension indicates that a property conflicts with another, ensuring that certain combinations of properties are not set together. This is ideal for situations where certain attributes are mutually exclusive or setting one attribute invalidates another.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        name_prefix:
          type: string
          x-speakeasy-conflicts-with: name
        id:
          type: string
        generated_name_options:
          type: object
          properties:
            prefix:
              type: string
              x-speakeasy-conflicts-with:
                - ../name_prefix
                - ../name
                - ../id
```

```tf
resource "example_pet" "happy_pet" {
  name = "Mrs Poppy"
  name_prefix = "Mrs"
}
```

```txt
$ terraform plan
│ Error: Invalid Attribute Combination
│ 
│   with example_pet.happy_pet,
│   on provider.tf line 39, in resource "example_pet" "happy_pet":
│   3:   name_prefix = "test"
│ 
│ Attribute "name" cannot be specified when "name_prefix" is specified
```

## Enforce Mutually Exclusive Attributes (x-speakeasy-xor-with)

The `x-speakeasy-xor-with` extension ensures that exactly one of the listed attributes must be configured at the same time. If multiple attributes are set simultaneously or if no attribute is set, Terraform plan validation fails. This differs from `x-speakeasy-conflicts-with` in that it requires exactly one attribute to be set, while `conflicts-with` allows zero or one attribute to be set.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        this:
          type: string
        that:
          type: string
        another:
          type: string
          # user MUST configure exactly one of: this, that, or another
          x-speakeasy-xor-with:
            - ../this
            - ../that
```

```tf
resource "example_pet" "happy_pet" {
  this = "value1"
  that = "value2"  # Error: exactly one field must be set
}
```

```txt
$ terraform plan
│ Error: Invalid Attribute Combination
│ 
│   with example_pet.happy_pet,
│   on provider.tf line 2:
│   2:   that = "value2"
│ 
│ Exactly one of attributes [this, that, another] must be specified
```

## Enforce Required Attribute Dependencies (x-speakeasy-required-with)

The `x-speakeasy-required-with` extension ensures that when the annotated field is configured, all the specified dependent fields must also be configured. This is useful for enforcing that certain fields are always configured together.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
        breed:
          type: string
          # when breed is set, name and age must also be set
          x-speakeasy-required-with:
            - ../name
            - ../age
```

```tf
resource "example_pet" "happy_pet" {
  breed = "Labrador"  # Error: name and age must also be set when breed is set
}
```

```txt
$ terraform plan
│ Error: Missing Required Attributes
│ 
│   with example_pet.happy_pet,
│   on provider.tf line 2:
│   2:   breed = "Labrador"
│ 
│ The following attributes must be configured when 'breed' is specified: [name, age]
```

## OpenAPI Plan Validators

Speakeasy automatically generates certain Terraform configuration value validation handlers based on your OpenAPI specification. When configuration validation is defined, Terraform raises invalid value errors before users can apply their configuration for a better user experience.

By default, these OpenAPI specification properties are automatically handled:

- For `string` types: `enum`, `maxLength`, `minLength`, and `pattern`
- For `integer` types: `enum`, `minimum`, and `maximum`
- For `array` types: `maxItems`, `minItems`, and `uniqueItems`

For use cases not automatically handled, add custom validation logic or reach out to the team.

### Add Custom Validation Logic

Use the `x-speakeasy-plan-validators` extension to add custom validation logic to Terraform plan operations and ensure configurations meet predefined criteria before execution. This extension is essential for scenarios requiring advanced validation logic that JSON Schema cannot accommodate.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-plan-validators: AgeValidator
```

In this scenario, when Speakeasy next generates the Terraform provider, it will bootstrap a custom validator file located at `internal/validators/int64validators/age_validator.go`, and import the schema configuration wherever `x-speakeasy-plan-validators: AgeValidator` is referenced. You can modify the validator file to contain your logic.

#### Implementation Notes

1. A plan validator is a type conformant to the `terraform-plugin-framework` expected interface. A unique plan validator will be bootstrapped in the appropriate subfolder for the Terraform type it is applied to: `boolvalidators`, `float64validators`, `int64validators`, `listvalidators`, `mapvalidators`, `numbervalidators`, `objectvalidators`, `setvalidators`, or `stringvalidators`. Speakeasy will always create and use a file as `snake_case.go` for a given `x-speakeasy-plan-validators` value.

2. A plan validator operates on the raw (untyped) Terraform value types. However, you can convert a Terraform type to a value type Speakeasy manages (`type_mytype.go`) by using the included reflection utility. This is useful for applying validators to complex types like `list`, `map`, `object`, and `set`.

3. While working with a plan validator, you have the ability to perform various tasks, including initiating network requests. However, it's important to ensure that plan validations do not result in any unintended side effects. Please refer to [the HashiCorp guidance on plan validator development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/validation) or reach out in our Slack if you have questions. 

4. It is possible to have an array of plan validators, for example, `x-speakeasy-plan-validators: [MinAgeValidator, MaxAgeValidator]`.

5. A validator can only be applied to a resource attribute. Validators cannot be applied at the same level as the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation because that becomes the "root" of the Terraform resource. However, validators can access or refer to any data in the entire resource (for an example, see the `x-speakeasy-conflicts-with` validator). The annotation will be ignored for data sources.

6. Speakeasy regenerations do not delete user-written code. If the validator is no longer in use, it will be ignored (no longer referenced) but the source file will remain. You might want to delete such an orphaned validation file for repository hygiene.

## Add Custom Plan Modification Logic

Use the `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers` extension to add custom plan modification logic to Terraform plan operations. Plan modifiers enable advanced default value, resource replacement, and difference suppression logic.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        age:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers: AgeModifier
```

In this scenario, when Speakeasy next generates the Terraform provider, it will bootstrap a custom plan modifier file located at `internal/planmodifiers/int64planmodifier/age_modifier.go`, and import the schema configuration wherever `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers: AgeModifier` is referenced. You can edit the plan modifier file to contain your logic.

### Implementation Notes

1. A plan modifier is a type conformant to the `terraform-plugin-framework` expected interface. A unique plan modifier will be bootstrapped in the appropriate subfolder for the Terraform type it is applied to: `boolplanmodifiers`, `float64planmodifiers`, `int64planmodifiers`, `listplanmodifiers`, `mapplanmodifiers`, `numberplanmodifiers`, `objectplanmodifiers`, `setplanmodifiers`, or `stringplanmodifiers`. Speakeasy will always create and use a file as `snake_case.go` for a given `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers` value.

2. A plan modifier operates on the raw (untyped) Terraform value types. However, you can convert a Terraform type to a value type Speakeasy manages (`type_mytype.go`) by using the included reflection utility. This is useful for applying modifiers to complex types like `list`, `map`, `object`, and `set`.

3. While working with a plan modifier, you have the ability to perform various tasks, including initiating network requests. However, it's important to ensure that plan modifiers do not result in any unintended side effects. Please refer to [the HashiCorp guidance on plan modifier development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/plan-modification) or reach out in our Slack if you have questions.

4. It is possible to have an array of plan modifiers, for example, `x-speakeasy-plan-modifiers: [FirstModifier, SecondModifier]`.

5. A modifier can only be applied to a resource attribute. The annotation will be ignored for data sources. Modifiers cannot be applied at the same level as the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation because that becomes the "root" of the Terraform resource.

6. Speakeasy regenerations do not delete user-written code. If the modifier is no longer in use, it will be ignored (no longer referenced) but the source file will remain. You might want to delete such an orphaned modifier file for repository hygiene.

##  Specify Resource Version

The `x-speakeasy-entity-version` extension specifies the version of a given resource and should *only* be used if you need to write a state migrator, for instance, if you are changing the type of a field.

Terraform resource versions are zero-indexed and default to `0`. For your first breaking change requiring a state migrator, set `x-speakeasy-entity-version: 1`. Each state migrator function must migrate from the previous version of the state.

If this is set, a boilerplate state upgrader will be written and hooked into `internal/stateupgraders/your_resource_v1.go`. Please refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/resources/state-upgrade) for guidance on writing a state migrator.

## Configuring Environment Values

Use the `environmentVariables` configuration in your `gen.yaml` to set up default values for provider variables to be pulled in from a user environment variable. This is useful for mapping known environment values that will hold an API key into the provider.

``` yaml
terraform:
  environmentVariables:
    - env: EXAMPLE_SERVER_URL_FROM_ENV_VAR
      providerAttribute: server_url
    - env: EXAMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN
      providerAttribute: access_token
```

The `environmentVariables` configuration is expected to be a list of objects with `{env: string, providerAttribute: string}` keys and values. These will create associations from environment variables (referenced as `env`) with provider attributes (referenced as `providerAttribute`).

## Custom Resources or Data Sources

If you would like to include an existing resource that is outside of the Speakeasy-generated provider, reference it in `gen.yaml` like so:

```yaml
terraform:
  additionalResources:
    - importAlias: custom
      importLocation: github.com/custom/terraform-provider-example/src/custom_resource
      resource: custom.NewCustomResource
  additionalDataSources:
    - importAlias: custom
      importLocation: github.com/custom/terraform-provider-example/src/custom_datasource
      datasource: custom.NewCustomDataSource
```

The `additionalResources` key is expected to contain a list of `{ importLocation?: string, importAlias?: string, resource: string }` objects. Each `resource` will be inserted into the provider resource list. If `importLocation` or `importAlias` is defined, Speakeasy will add that to the import list at the top of the provider file. The value of `resource` is arbitrary text, and could contain a function invocation if desired.

The `additionalDataSources` key follows the same syntax, but with `datasource` as the text string to be inserted into the list instead of `resource`.

To learn more about how to write a Terraform resource, please consult the [official Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework).

## Modifying Resource and Data Source Descriptions

The `x-speakeasy-entity-description` extension allows you to modify the description of a Terraform resource or data source. This is useful when augmenting the documentation in your OpenAPI specification with documentation for your specific resources. This documentation is expected to be in Markdown format. Use this extension alongside your `x-speakeasy-entity` extension.

Alternatively, a template folder can be written to customize any or all aspects of generated documentation in alignment with [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs).

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Order:
      description: An order helps you make coffee
      x-speakeasy-entity: Order
      x-speakeasy-entity-description: |
        The order resource allows you to declaratively construct an order for coffee.

        resource "speakeasy_order" "example" {
          name = "Filter Blend"
          price = 11.5
        }

```

## Deduplicate Terraform Types

The `terraform` types folder includes a representation of your data models that is appropriate for the `terraform-plugin-framework` type system. However, if you have multiple types with the same *signature* (e.g. the same set of child property *types*), there might be a lot of these types that are effectively duplicated. To minimize the git repository / binary size, it might make sense to deduplicate these by re-using types with the same *signature* across different resources. If you would like to enable this, set the following configuration option:

This option is `false` by default.

```yaml
terraform:
  enableTypeDeduplication: true
```

## Speciality Annotations

The annotations in this section are not commonly used within Speakeasy. We recommend contacting our team to help determine if they are correct for you.

### Force Mark Property as Read-Only

The `x-speakeasy-param-readonly` extension marks a property as read-only. Any user attempt to modify it in Terraform will result in a runtime error. This prevents unintended changes to critical properties in Terraform configurations.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-readonly: true
```

### Force Designate a Property as Optional

Apply `x-speakeasy-param-optional` to any property to designate it as optional. This extension takes precedence over the required attribute in the JSON Schema specification, providing flexibility in Terraform configurations by allowing optional settings for certain properties.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-optional: true
```

### Force Resource Recreation on Property Change

Properties marked with `x-speakeasy-param-force-new` will cause the associated Terraform resource to be destroyed and recreated whenever the property value changes. This ensures that any alteration to the property triggers a complete recreation of the object.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          x-speakeasy-param-force-new: true
```

### Update Behavior for Plan-Only Attributes

The `x-speakeasy-terraform-plan-only` extension ensures that only the values from the Terraform plan are used during updates, overriding any prior state or default values provided by the API. By preventing prior state values from being merged into the update request, the annotation ensures that omitted or null values in the plan are correctly reflected in API calls.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        properties:
        name:
          type: string
        id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          x-speakeasy-terraform-plan-only: true
```

## Keywords

<Callout title="Tip" variant="success">
This section is not an exhaustive list of available keyword options. If you&apos;re unsure whether a keyword is supported, please reach out to our team at support@speakeasy.com.
</Callout>

### The `anyOf` Keyword

Terraform has limited support for the `anyOf` keyword due to its less flexible type system than JSON Schema. For instance, managing `anyOf` with multiple subtypes requires a large set of combined types, leading to practical and implementation challenges.

Consider replacing `anyOf` in your schema with `oneOf` or `allOf`. This adjustment aligns with Terraform's capabilities: `oneOf` for union types and `allOf` for intersection types.

For more guidance or to discuss schema adaptations, contact our support team at support@speakeasy.com.

### The `oneOf` Keyword

In Terraform, `oneOf` is defined as a `SingleNestedAttribute` where each potential child is represented by a unique key. To ensure compliance with `oneOf` semantics, `conflicts-with` plan validators are added to confirm that only one of these keys is active at any given time.

If a `oneOf` is declared at the root level of an entity, the Speakeasy generator will extract common property attributes and duplicate them into the root level. This is important if, for instance, a common `id` property is required for making read, update, or delete requests.

### The `allOf` Keyword

For `allOf`, Speakeasy merges all sub-schemas into a single combined attribute, creating a unified schema component that encapsulates all specified properties.
