# Generate a Terraform provider from OpenAPI / Swagger

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that uses providers to manage cloud infrastructure through API calls. Creating and maintaining Terraform providers, which are typically written in Go, requires specialized skills and frequent updates to keep up with API changes.

Speakeasy simplifies creating and maintaining Terraform providers by generating providers from OpenAPI documents. This eliminates the need for Go expertise, keeps providers up-to-date, and reduces the complexity of developing and maintaining providers for cloud environments.

For a detailed overview of supported features, refer to the [Terraform support matrix](/docs/terraform-support-matrix).

## Prerequisites

To create a Terraform provider with Speakeasy, you need:

- The [Speakeasy CLI](speakeasy-cli/getting-started)
- An API spec in a supported format:

| Spec Format        | Supported |
| ------------------ | :-------: |
| OpenAPI 3.0        |    ✅     |
| OpenAPI 3.1        |    ✅     |
| JSON Schema        |    ✅     |
| Postman Collection |    🔜     |

<Callout title="TIP" variant="success">
If you are using an unsupported spec format, use these tools to help you convert to a supported format:

- [Swagger2.0 -> OpenAPI v3.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-converter)
- [Postman -> OpenAPI v3.0](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/)
</Callout>

## Add annotations

Use the `x-speakeasy-entity` annotation to specify objects to be included as Terraform entities in the provider.

```yaml
paths:
 /pet:
   post:
     ...
     x-speakeasy-entity-operation: Pet#create
     ...
Pet:
 x-speakeasy-entity: Pet
 ...

```

Terraform Usage:

```HCL
resource "petstore_pet" "myPet" {
  ...
}
```

Speakeasy infers Terraform types from your JSON Schema, focusing on the semantics of the `CREATE` and `UPDATE` requests and responses. You **don't need to** define any specific Terraform types in your OpenAPI document.

1. **Required vs. optional:** If a property is required in the `CREATE` request body, it's marked as `Required: true`; otherwise, it's `Optional: true`.
2. **Computed properties:** Properties that appear in a response body but are absent from the `CREATE` request are marked as `Computed: true`. This indicates that Terraform will compute the properties' values.
3. **The `ForceNew` property:** If a property exists in the `CREATE` request but is not present in the `UPDATE` request, it's labeled `ForceNew`.
4. **Enum validation:** When an attribute is defined as an enum, Speakeasy configures a `Validator` for runtime type checks. This ensures that all request properties precisely match one of the enumerated values.
5. **`READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` dependencies**: Every parameter essential for `READ`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations must either be part of the `CREATE` API response body or be consistently required in the `CREATE` API request. This ensures that all necessary parameters are available for these operations.

## Enhance generated documentation

Speakeasy helps you autogenerate documentation using the HashiCorp `terraform-plugin-docs` tools and packages. For best results, we recommend:

1. **Include descriptions:** Ensure your OpenAPI document contains detailed descriptions of resources, attributes, and operations. Clear and concise descriptions help users understand the purpose and use of each component.
2. **Provide examples:** Use examples in your OpenAPI document to illustrate how resources and attributes should be configured. Speakeasy leverages these examples to generate usage snippets that users can refer to when starting with your provider.

The Swagger Pet Store generates the following usage snippet for the pet resource:

```go "petstore_pet" "my_pet" {
    id   = 10
    name = "doggie"
    photo_urls = [
        "...",
    ]
}.
```

## Generate a Terraform provider

Run the Speakeasy `quickstart` command:

```bash
speakeasy quickstart
```

Follow the interactive guide, providing the necessary information when prompted, including the path to the spec. Select `terraform` as the language. 

When you've completed the quickstart, you can regenerate the Terraform provider at any time by running `speakeasy run`.

## Frequently Asked Questions


**Do the generated Terraform providers support importing resources?**

Yes, generated Terraform providers support importing resources. However, certain prerequisites and considerations must be taken into account:

**Prerequisites**

1. **API specification:** Ensure the OpenAPI document defines an annotated and type-complete API operation for reading each resource. Tag the operation with `x-speakeasy-entity-operation: MyEntity#read`.

2. **Complete `READ` operation:** Attributes of a resource not defined in the `READ` API are set to `null` by Terraform during the import process.

**Simple keys**

A simple key is a single required ID field that is directly exposed to `terraform import` operations. For example, if the `pet` resource has a single `id` field, the import command will look like this: `terraform import petstore_pet.my_pet my_pet_id`.

**Handling composite keys**

Speakeasy natively supports the direct import of resources with multiple ID fields. Speakeasy generates code that enables import functionality by requiring users to provide a JSON-encoded object with all necessary parameters. In addition to generating documentation, Speakeasy generates appropriate error messages to be displayed if the proper syntax is not followed.

**Import composite keys by block**

An import block allows you to import a resource into the Terraform state by generating the corresponding Terraform configuration. Using a composite key, the import block will look like this:

```hcl test.tf
import {
  id = jsonencode({
    primary_key_one: "9cedad30-2a8a-40f7-9d65-4fabb04e54ff"
    primary_key_two: "e20c40a0-40e8-49ac-b5d0-6e2f41f9e66f"
  })
  to = my_test_resource.my_example
}
```

```bash
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```

**Import composite keys using the CLI**

To import a resource with composite keys using the Terraform CLI, use the `terraform import` command:

```bash
terraform import my_test_resource.my_example '{ "primary_key_one": "9cedad30-2a8a-40f7-9d65-4fabb04e54ff", "primary_key_two": "e20c40a0-40e8-49ac-b5d0-6e2f41f9e66f" }'
```
