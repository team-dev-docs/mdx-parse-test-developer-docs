At Speakeasy, we create [idiomatic SDKs](../docs/sdk-design/intro.md) in the most popular languages. Our generators follow principles that ensure we create SDKs that offer the best developer experience so that you can focus on building your API, and your developer-users can focus on delighting their users.

In this post, we'll compare TypeScript SDKs created by Speakeasy to those generated by APIMatic.

TL;DR? Here's what we found:

- **Ease of installation:** The Speakeasy CLI has a straightforward installation process, especially for macOS users, with a single dependency-free binary. APIMatic, while also straightforward, requires Node.js and is installed using npm, which might add complexity for some users.
- **Code generation:** In our test, the SDK generated by APIMatic via CLI had issues with the `src/clientInterface.ts` file. Although the APIMatic support team responded, the problem persisted in our Docker environment test. By contrast, Speakeasy generated a complete and error-free SDK on our first attempt.
- **Documentation and code structure:** The Speakeasy-created SDK includes comprehensive documentation, and relies on Zod for runtime data parsing, making it easier for developers to understand and use. The structure and organization of the SDK were clear and intuitive.
- **Developer experience and flexibility:** Speakeasy seems to place a significant emphasis on the developer experience, offering more customization options and a focus on the API-Developer Experience (DevEx). This could be particularly beneficial for teams looking for greater control over their SDKs.
- **Response to issues:** While the APIMatic support team was responsive, the resolution provided did not address the issue effectively in our case. Since we encountered no issues creating an SDK with Speakeasy, there was no need to similarly test the Speakeasy support team's responsiveness.
- **Bundle sizes and browser compatibility:** Even when including Zod for runtime type checking, bundles using Speakeasy's SDKs are smaller than those created with APIMatic SDKs. This could be beneficial for developers who need to keep their bundle sizes small. Speakeasy's SDKs are also compatible with modern browsers, which is essential for web developers.

<div className="Callout" data-title="NOTE" data-variant="info">
  Speakeasy and APIMatic each have their strengths, but Speakeasy's ease of
  installation, reliable code generation, and developer-focused features give it
  the edge.
</div>

Of course, individual experiences may vary based on specific needs and use cases, so you might want to follow our process below to test-drive both tools.

## Comparing Speakeasy and APIMatic

Before we get into the technical walkthrough, let's see whether each platform targets the languages your users require, offers features you want, and provides the support you can rely on.

### SDK Generation Targets

At Speakeasy, we believe it is crucial to meet your users where they are by supporting SDKs in languages your users depend on. Anyone who has had to maintain custom SDK code because a vendor doesn't support their tech stack knows how frustrating this can be.

This table shows the current, as of September 2024, languages and platforms targeted by Speakeasy and APIMatic. These lists will change over time, so check the official documentation for the latest language support.

| Language           |          Speakeasy           |  APIMatic  |
| ------------------ | :--------------------------: | :--------: |
| Python             |              ✅              |     ✅     |

| Postman Collection |              ✅              |     ❌     |

We're always open to expanding our language support, but would only ever do this if we have the in-house experience to create idiomatic, best-in-class SDKs for a given language. [Let us know](/roadmap) if you would like to suggest a language or platform to support.

### SDK Features

The table below compares the current SDK features offered by Speakeasy and APIMatic as of September 2024. Both Speakeasy and APIMatic are under active development, so these features may change over time.

| Feature                     | Speakeasy |        APIMatic         |
| --------------------------- | :-------: | :---------------------: |
| Union types                 |    ✅     |           ✅            |
| Discriminated union types   |    ✅     | ⚠ non-OpenAPI standard |
| Server-sent events          |    ✅     |           ❌            |
| Retries                     |    ✅     |           ✅            |
| Pagination                  |    ✅     |           ❌            |
| Async support               |    ✅     |           ✅            |
| Streaming uploads           |    ✅     |           ❌            |
| OAuth 2.0                   |    ✅     |           ✅            |
| Custom SDK naming           |    ✅     |           ✅            |
| Customize SDK structure     |    ✅     |           ❌            |
| Custom dependency injection |    ✅     |           ❌            |

APIMatic lacks advanced SDK customization features, and we couldn't find any code or documentation related to pagination. These are features Speakeasy's users rely on.

### Platform Features

Speakeasy's primary interface is an open-source, full-featured, and portable CLI. Developers use our CLI to experiment and iterate locally and to customize their CI/CD workflows.

APIMatic's CLI depends on Node.js and several packages. This makes it much less portable. In testing, we also found that it does not generate SDKs as reliably as the APIMatic web interface.

| Feature                  | Speakeasy | APIMatic |
| ------------------------ | :-------: | :------: |
| GitHub CI/CD             |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| CLI                      |    ✅     |    ⚠    |
| Web interface            |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Package publishing       |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| OpenAPI linting          |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Documentation generation |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Test generation          |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| OpenAPI overlays         |    ✅     |    ❌    |
| Change detection         |    ✅     |    ❌    |
| Developer portal         |    ❌     |    ✅    |

### Enterprise Support

Both Speakeasy and APIMatic offer support for Enterprise customers. This includes features like concierge onboarding, private Slack channels, and enterprise SLAs.

| Feature               | Speakeasy | APIMatic |
| --------------------- | :-------: | :------: |
| Concierge onboarding  |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Private Slack channel |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| Enterprise SLAs       |    ✅     |    ✅    |
| User issues triage    |    ✅     |    ✅    |

### Pricing

Speakeasy offers a free plan, while APIMatic offers a limited free trial.

| Plan          | Speakeasy                               | APIMatic                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free          | 1 free Published SDK, 50 endpoints      | Trial only                                                  |
| Startup       | 1 free + $250/mo/SDK, 50 endpoints each | N/A                                                         |
| Lite: Starter | N/A                                     | $15/mo. 1 API, 10 endpoints, no team members.               |
| Lite: Basic   | N/A                                     | Custom. 1 API, 20 endpoints, 2 team members.                |
| Business      | N/A                                     | Custom. Up to 50 APIs, 100 endpoints each, 15 team members. |
| Enterprise    | Custom                                  | Custom                                                      |

Speakeasy's free plan is more generous than both Lite plans offered by APIMatic.

## Speakeasy vs APIMatic Technical Walkthrough

Let's create SDKs with Speakeasy and APIMatic from a single API specification, to compare the output and customization features.

We've created an OpenAPI document that describes a fictional bookstore API. You can find the complete OpenAPI document in the [example repository](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy-apimatic-comparison), but let's take a look at what's included.

<div className="ScrollyCoding" data-classname="ch-scrollycoding-full-height">

## !!steps

Our bookstore OpenAPI document is compliant with OpenAPI 3.1, which is supported by both Speakeasy and APIMatic. We define a basic info section and add a single development server.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=1:15
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt
```

---

## !!steps

Here we define two tags to organize our operations with: `Books` and `Orders`.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=16:20
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt
```

---

## !!steps

We define one global authentication method, `apiKey`.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=21:22
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt
```

---

## !!steps

Let's examine the operations we'll need an SDK for, starting with `getAllBooks`.

This operation takes no input.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=2:29
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 23:77
```

---

## !!steps

What makes this operation interesting is that it returns an array of objects of three types: `ProgrammingBook`, `FantasyBook`, and `SciFiBook`. Each object's type is determined by the book's category.

This example allows us to test how our SDK generators handle discriminated unions in OpenAPI.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=2:29 mark=19:29
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 23:77
```

---

## !!steps

Next up, we have an operation that adds a book to the database, called `addBook`.

This operation takes one object of type `ProgrammingBook`, `FantasyBook`, or `SciFiBook` as input.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml mark=15:24
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 78:144
```

---

## !!steps

Our next book-related operation, `updateBookCoverById`, takes a book ID as a path variable, and an image as a binary payload.

We include this operation to test how our SDK generators handle binary payloads.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml mark=22:28
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 206:233
```

---

## !!steps

Our final book-related operation, `getBookById`, takes a book ID as a path variable, and returns one of our book objects.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=1:32
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 145:205
```

---

## !!steps

Next up, we have an operation that returns a list of all orders in the database, called `getAllOrders`.

This operation returns an array of `Order` objects, so that we can test an array of nested objects.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml focus=1:19
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 237:278
```

---

## !!steps

Our next order-related operation, `createOrder`, takes an object of type `NewOrder` as input, and returns an object of type `Order`.

We include this one to test how our SDK generators help users avoid common mistakes, like passing the wrong type to an operation.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml mark=16,32
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 279:310
```

---

## !!steps

Finally, we have an operation that returns a stream of order events, called `getOrderStream`.

We include this operation to test how our SDK generators handle server-sent events.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml mark=14
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 358:373
```

---

## !!steps

The remainder of the OpenAPI document defines the components used in the operations above.

```yaml ! openapi.yaml
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 374:639
```

</div>

We'll save this as `openapi.yaml` in the root of our test repository.

### Installing the APIMatic CLI

The APIMatic CLI depends on Node.js, and we'll install it using npm. In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm install -g @apimatic/cli
```

This will install the APIMatic CLI in your global `node_modules` folder and create the `apimatic` command.

On our test environment, this installed 250 npm packages, 17 of which were deprecated.

Check your APIMatic CLI version:

```bash
apimatic --version
# @apimatic/cli/1.1.0-alpha.5 darwin-arm64 node-v20.17.0
```

Authenticate with APIMatic by running:

```bash
apimatic auth:login
```

Then enter your APIMatic email address and password.

The APIMatic CLI is also [open source](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-cli), with the latest update in September 2023.

### Installing the Speakeasy CLI

To install the Speakeasy CLI, we'll follow the Speakeasy [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/introduction#getting-started) guide.

1. Create an account on [Speakeasy](https://app.speakeasy.com/).
2. Install the Speakeasy CLI using Homebrew or cURL:

   ```bash
   brew install speakeasy-api/tap/speakeasy
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://go.speakeasy.com/cli-install.sh | sh
   ```

3. Authenticate the CLI with Speakeasy:

   ```bash
   speakeasy auth login
   ```

You can check the Speakeasy version:

```bash
speakeasy --version
# speakeasy version 1.390.5
# darwin_arm64
```

### Linting OpenAPI Documents

Both Speakeasy and APIMatic can validate OpenAPI documents.

Validate `openapi.yaml` using APIMatic:

```bash
apimatic api:validate --file=openapi.yaml
# Validating specification file... done
# Info: One or more elements in the API specification has a missing description.  (View Details)Source: API.
# ...
# Specification file provided is valid
```

Speakeasy goes beyond validation by linting an OpenAPI document, and then providing separate errors, warnings, and hints. This includes a link to a shareable lint report for easier collaboration.

```bash
speakeasy lint openapi -s openapi.yaml
```

Both platforms validated our OpenAPI document without errors, so let's move on to generating SDKs.

### Generating an SDK Using the APIMatic CLI Tutorial

We'll follow the [APIMatic tutorial](https://docs.apimatic.io/generate-sdks/create-sdks/create-sdks-through-cli/) to generate a TypeScript SDK.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
apimatic sdk:generate --platform=typescript --file="openapi.yaml"
```

This should print the following to the terminal:

```
Generating SDK... done
Downloading SDK... done
Success! Your SDK is located at ~/speakeasy-apimatic-comparison/openapi_sdk_typescript
```

## Inspecting the APIMatic-Generated SDK

To see what was generated, run the tree command from the new SDK directory:

```bash
tree openapi_sdk_typescript
```

</FileTree>*/}

Poking around the source, we found that the generated SDK did not contain any model code or types related to our bookstore example.

### Corrupted SDK Generation

In a previous test from January 2024, we used the standard OpenAPI Petstore example API to generate an SDK using APIMatic. In that case, the SDK also did not contain any models, and we encountered a bizarre error - the `src/clientInterface.ts` file seems to have been generated incorrectly. Here's what we found:

```typescript src/clientInterface.ts
SdkRequestBuilderFactory = RequestBuilderFactory<
  Server,
  AuthParams
>;

export type SdkRequestBuilder = ReturnType<SdkRequestBuilderFactory>;

export type Server = 'default';

export type AuthParams = boolean;
/**
 * Swagger PetstoreLib
 *
 * This file was automatically generated by APIMATIC v3.0 ( https://www.apimatic.io ).
 */

import { RequestBuilderFactory } from './core';

export interface ClientInterface {
  getRequestBuilderFactory(): SdkRequestBuilderFactory;
}

export type
```

The file seems to start in the middle, then wraps around.

This error gave us an opportunity to engage with the APIMatic support team, so we'll take a brief detour and share our experience: After seven days of filing the bug report, we received a curt, "We've tested out the SDKs via the CLI method and they're being generated as expected." To be fair, the support agent did offer to provide further assistance if we still had a problem.

As any responsible tester would do, we decided to isolate the test environment from our system to be sure the issue didn't stem from an error on our side. We're using nvm on macOS after all, and issues can crop up when switching between Node versions.

We created a Dockerfile to install the requirements and generate an SDK:

```docker
FROM node:latest
ARG apimatic_auth_key=APIMATIC_KEY
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY petstore.yaml /usr/src/app
RUN npm install -g @apimatic/cli
RUN apimatic auth:login --auth-key=$apimatic_auth_key
RUN apimatic sdk:generate --platform=typescript --file="petstore.yaml"
RUN cat petstore_sdk_typescript/src/clientInterface.ts
```

Replace `$APIMATIC_KEY` with your APIMatic API key, then run:

```bash
docker build -t apimatic-petstore --build-arg apimatic_auth_key=$APIMATIC_KEY --progress plain .
```

On a second run with Docker, the bug appeared to fix itself, only to fail again later.

Sure enough, the result was the same - the `src/clientInterface.ts` file starts in the middle and wraps around. This might be caused by a race condition in the code that downloads and unzips the SDK from APIMatic. Tempting as it is to track this error down, we have SDKs to generate, so we'll move on.

If you're following along, remember to delete your Docker image, as it contains your API key. The key also appears in your Docker history.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker image rm apimatic-petstore
```

In both our Petstore and Bookstore examples, the APIMatic CLI failed to generate a usable SDK.

We need to find another way to generate an SDK using APIMatic - let's try the web app.

### Generating an SDK Using the APIMatic UI

Log in to the APIMatic web application and follow the prompts to import our `openapi.yaml` document as a new API.

Click on **Generate** and select TypeScript. This generates a TypeScript SDK, which downloads to your computer as a zip file. We'll save this in our working directory as `bookstore-sdk-apimatic`.

Here's what's inside:

This looks more complete, and none of the files are corrupted, so we'll move on to trying the Speakeasy generator.

### Create an SDK Using the Speakeasy CLI

To generate an SDK using Speakeasy, run the following in the terminal:

```bash Terminal
speakeasy generate sdk \
    --schema openapi.yaml \
    --lang typescript \
    --out ./bookstore-sdk-speakeasy
```

Speakeasy lints the OpenAPI document, then creates a new folder, `bookstore-sdk-speakeasy`, with the generated SDK.

### Setting Up a Mock Server

We used [Stoplight Prism](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) to generate a mock server to test our SDKs:

```bash Terminal
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
prism mock openapi.yaml
```

This command starts a mock server at `http://localhost:4010`.

### SDK Code Comparison

Now that we have two SDKs, let's compare the code generated by each platform.

#### Runtime Type Checking

Speakeasy creates SDKs that are type-safe from development to production. As our CEO recently wrote, [Type Safe is better than Type Faith](/post/type-safe-vs-type-faith).

Speakeasy uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate data at runtime. Data sent to the server and data received from the server are validated against Zod definitions in the client.

This provides safer runtime code execution and helps developers who use your SDK to provide early feedback about data entered by their end users. Furthermore, trusting data validation on the client side allows developers more confidence to build [optimistic UIs](https://medium.com/distant-horizons/using-optimistic-ui-to-delight-your-users-ac819a81d59a) that update as soon as an end user enters data, greatly improving end users' perception of your API's speed.

Let's see how Speakeasy's runtime type checking works in an example.

Consider the following `Book` component from our OpenAPI document:

```yaml mark=18:21
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 379:406
```

The highlighted `price` field above has the type `integer`.

```typescript speakeasy-example.ts mark=17
// techbooks-speakeasy SDK created by Speakeasy
import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

const bookStore = new TechBooks({
  apiKey: "123",
});

async function run() {
  await bookStore.books.addBook({
    author: {
      name: "Robert C. Martin",
      photo: "https://example.com/photos/robert.jpg",
      biography: 'Robert Cecil Martin, colloquially known as "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer...',
    },
    category: "Programming",
    description: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
    price: 29.99,
    title: "Clean Code",
  });
}

run();
```

The `price` field in the `Book` object in our test code is set to `29.99`, which is a floating-point number. This will cause a validation error before the data is sent to the server, as the `price` field is expected to be an integer.

[Handling Zod validation errors](https://zod.dev/?id=error-handling) is straightforward, and allows developers to provide meaningful feedback to their end users early in the process.

The same book object in code using the SDK generated by APIMatic will only be validated on the server. This means that the error will only be caught from the client's perspective _after_ the data is sent to the server, and the server responds with an error message.

If the server is not set up to validate the `price` field, the error will _not be caught at all_, leading to unexpected behavior in your developer-users' applications.

As a result, developers using the SDK generated by APIMatic may need to write additional client-side validation code to catch these errors before they are sent to the server.

#### Dependency Injection: SDK Hooks

Speakeasy generates a clean mechanism for safely injecting custom code.

The abridged code below is from the SDK generated by Speakeasy:

```typescript speakeasy/hooks/types.ts
/*
 * Code generated by Speakeasy (https://speakeasyapi.dev). DO NOT EDIT.
 */

// ...

export interface BeforeCreateRequestHook {
    /**
     * A hook that is called before the SDK creates a `Request` object. The hook
     * can modify how a request is constructed since certain modifications, like
     * changing the request URL, cannot be done on a request object directly.
     */
    beforeCreateRequest: (hookCtx: BeforeCreateRequestContext, input: RequestInput) => RequestInput;
}

export interface BeforeRequestHook {
    /**
     * A hook that is called before the SDK sends a request. The hook can
     * introduce instrumentation code such as logging, tracing and metrics or
     * replace the request before it is sent or throw an error to stop the
     * request from being sent.
     */
    beforeRequest: (hookCtx: BeforeRequestContext, request: Request) => Awaitable<Request>;
}

// ...
```

The types above are well documented, but you can read more about [Speakeasy SDK Hooks](/docs/customize/code/sdk-hooks) in Speakeasy's documentation.

In short, hooks are typed and contain relevant context depending on when in the lifecycle they are applied. To add hooks, register hooks in the `src/hooks/registration.ts` file in your TypeScript SDK.

Here's an example hook:

```typescript src/hooks/registration.ts
import { Hooks } from "./types";

/*
 * This file is only ever generated once on the first generation and then is free to be modified.
 * Any hooks you wish to add should be registered in the initHooks function. Feel free to define them
 * in this file or in separate files in the hooks folder.
 */

export function initHooks(hooks: Hooks) {
    // Add hooks by calling hooks.register{ClientInit/BeforeCreateRequest/BeforeRequest/AfterSuccess/AfterError}Hook
    // with an instance of a hook that implements that specific Hook interface
    // Hooks are registered per SDK instance, and are valid for the lifetime of the SDK instance

    hooks.registerBeforeCreateRequestHook(
        {
            beforeCreateRequest: (hookCtx, input) => {
                // Modify the request input here
                console.log("BeforeCreateRequestHook", input);
                console.log("HookContext", hookCtx);
                return input;
            },
        }
    );
}
```

Speakeasy also provides a clean abstraction to add dependencies to the SDK, by specifying dependencies in the SDK's gen.yaml file:

```yaml gen.yaml
typescript:
  additionalDependencies:
    dependencies:
      uuid: ^9.0.1
    devDependencies:
      "@types/uuid": "^9.0.8"
    peerDependencies: {}
```

Dependency injection and SDK customization are not well documented for APIMatic. Of course, developers can patch the generated SDKs as much as they want, but mixing generated and custom code is often a recipe for disaster.

#### OAuth Client Credentials Handling

Both SDKs handle OAuth 2.0 with client credentials.

Our bookstore API requires an OAuth 2.0 token with client credentials to access the API. Let's see how the SDKs handle this.

Consider the following OAuth 2.0 configuration from our OpenAPI document:

```yaml openapi.yaml
!from ./assets/openapi.yaml.txt 633:639
```

The SDK generated by Speakeasy takes a `clientID` and `clientSecret` when instantiating the SDK. The SDK also includes `ClientCredentialsHook` class that implements `BeforeRequestHook` to check whether the token is expired and refresh it if necessary. The hook also checks whether the client has the necessary scopes to access the endpoint, and handles authentication errors.

```typescript speakeasy-example.ts
// techbooks-speakeasy SDK created by Speakeasy
import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

const bookStore = new TechBooks({
  security: {
    // OAuth 2.0 client credentials
    clientID: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>",
    clientSecret: "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>",
  },
});

async function run() {
  // The SDK handles the token lifecycle, retries, and error handling for you
  await bookStore.books.addBook({
    // Book object
  });
}

run();
```

The SDK generated by APIMatic has similar functionality.

#### Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Streaming Responses

Our bookstore API includes an operation that streams orders to the client using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

```yaml mark=15
paths:
  /orderstream:
    get:
      summary: Get a stream of orders
      operationId: getOrderStream
      description: Returns a stream of orders
      tags:
        - Orders
      security:
        - apiKey: []
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A stream of orders
          content:
            text/event-stream:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/OrderStreamMessage"
```

Let's see how the SDKs handle this.

[Speakeasy generates types and methods for handling SSE](/docs/customize-sdks/streaming) without any customization. Here's an example of how to use the SDK to listen for new orders:

```typescript speakeasy-example.ts
import { TechBooks } from "techbooks-speakeasy";

const bookStore = new TechBooks({
  apiKey: 'KEY123',
});

async function run() {
  const result = await bookStore.orders.getOrderStream();

  if (result.orderStreamMessage == null) {
    throw new Error('Failed to create stream: received null value');
  }

  const stream = result.orderStreamMessage.stream;

  if (!stream || typeof stream.getReader !== 'function') {
    throw new Error('Invalid stream: expected a ReadableStream');
  }

  const reader = stream.getReader();

  try {
    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;
      console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(value));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading stream', error);
  } finally {
    reader.releaseLock();
  }
}

run();
```

(The example above does not run against a local Prism server, but you can test it against [Stoplight's hosted Prism](https://stoplight.io/) server.)

APIMatic does not generate SSE-handling code.

#### Discriminated Unions

Our OpenAPI document includes a `Book` component with a `category` field that can be one of three values: `Programming`, `Fantasy`, or `SciFi`.

This allows us to type the `Book` component in requests and responses as specific book types, such as `ProgrammingBook`, `FantasyBook`, and `SciFiBook`.

OpenAPI supports discriminated unions using the `discriminator` field in the schema. Here's an example of a response that returns an array of books of different types:

```yaml openapi.yaml
schema:
  type: array
  items:
    oneOf:
      - $ref: "#/components/schemas/ProgrammingBook"
      - $ref: "#/components/schemas/FantasyBook"
      - $ref: "#/components/schemas/SciFiBook"
    discriminator:
      propertyName: category
      mapping:
        Programming: "#/components/schemas/ProgrammingBook"
        Fantasy: "#/components/schemas/FantasyBook"
        Sci-fi: "#/components/schemas/SciFiBook"
```

Let's see how the SDKs handle this.

Speakeasy generates TypeScript types for each book type, and uses a discriminated union to handle the different book types. This enables developers to use the correct type when working with books of different categories. This pattern could just as easily apply to payment methods or delivery options.

The example below shows how Speakeasy defines the `ProgrammingBook` type. It also generates types for `FantasyBook` and `SciFiBook`.

In this example, you'll notice that the `category` field is optional in the `ProgrammingBook` type, but is enforced by Zod validation in the SDK.

```typescript speakeasy/books.ts mark=16,29,50,61
/*
 * Code generated by Speakeasy (https://speakeasyapi.dev). DO NOT EDIT.
 */

import { Author, Author$ } from "./author";
import * as z from "zod";

export type ProgrammingBook = {
    id?: number | undefined;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    /**
     * Price in USD cents
     */
    price: number;
    category?: "Programming" | undefined;
    author: Author;
    coverImage?: string | undefined;
};

/** @internal */
export namespace ProgrammingBook$ {
    export const inboundSchema: z.ZodType<ProgrammingBook, z.ZodTypeDef, unknown> = z
        .object({
            id: z.number().int().optional(),
            title: z.string(),
            description: z.string(),
            price: z.number().int(),
            category: z.literal("Programming").optional(),
            author: Author$.inboundSchema,
            cover_image: z.string().optional(),
        })
        .transform((v) => {
            return {
                ...(v.id === undefined ? null : { id: v.id }),
                title: v.title,
                description: v.description,
                price: v.price,
                ...(v.category === undefined ? null : { category: v.category }),
                author: v.author,
                ...(v.cover_image === undefined ? null : { coverImage: v.cover_image }),
            };
        });

    export type Outbound = {
        id?: number | undefined;
        title: string;
        description: string;
        price: number;
        category: "Programming";
        author: Author$.Outbound;
        cover_image?: string | undefined;
    };

    export const outboundSchema: z.ZodType<Outbound, z.ZodTypeDef, ProgrammingBook> = z
        .object({
            id: z.number().int().optional(),
            title: z.string(),
            description: z.string(),
            price: z.number().int(),
            category: z.literal("Programming").default("Programming" as const),
            author: Author$.outboundSchema,
            coverImage: z.string().optional(),
        })
        .transform((v) => {
            return {
                ...(v.id === undefined ? null : { id: v.id }),
                title: v.title,
                description: v.description,
                price: v.price,
                category: v.category,
                author: v.author,
                ...(v.coverImage === undefined ? null : { cover_image: v.coverImage }),
            };
        });
}
```

We can see how Speakeasy generates SDK code to handle the different book types in the response for the `getgetAllBooks` operation:

```typescript speakeasy/getallbooks.ts
/*
 * Code generated by Speakeasy (https://speakeasyapi.dev). DO NOT EDIT.
 */

import * as components from "../components";
import * as z from "zod";

export type ResponseBody =
    | (components.ProgrammingBook & { category: "Programming" })
    | (components.FantasyBook & { category: "Fantasy" })
    | (components.SciFiBook & { category: "Sci-fi" });

export type GetAllBooksResponse = {
    httpMeta: components.HTTPMetadata;
    /**
     * A list of books
     */
    responseBodies?:
        | Array<
              | (components.ProgrammingBook & { category: "Programming" })
              | (components.FantasyBook & { category: "Fantasy" })
              | (components.SciFiBook & { category: "Sci-fi" })
          >
        | undefined;
};

// ...
```

Note how the array elements in `responseBodies` are typed according to the book category.

This may seem like a trivial example, but it illustrates how Speakeasy generates types that are more specific and easier to work with than the types generated by APIMatic. This could, for instance, help developers correctly handle different book types in their applications.

APIMatic does not generate types for discriminated unions, and developers must manually handle the different book types in the response.

Here is the equivalent type definition generated by APIMatic:

```typescript apimatic/programmingBook.ts
/**
 * Bookstore APILib
 *
 * This file was automatically generated by APIMATIC v3.0 ( https://www.apimatic.io ).
 */

// ...

import { CategoryEnum, categoryEnumSchema } from './categoryEnum';

// ...

export interface ProgrammingBook {
  id?: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  /** Price in USD cents */
  price: number;
  category: CategoryEnum;
  author: Author2;
  coverImage?: string;
}

// ...
```

Following the `CategoryEnum` import:

```typescript apimatic/categoryEnum.ts
/**
 * Bookstore APILib
 *
 * This file was automatically generated by APIMATIC v3.0 ( https://www.apimatic.io ).
 */

// ...

/**
 * Enum for CategoryEnum
 */
export enum CategoryEnum {
  Scifi = 'Sci-fi',
  Fantasy = 'Fantasy',
  Programming = 'Programming',
}

// ...
```

Discriminating between different book types in the response is left to users.

### OpenAPI Overlays

If editing your OpenAPI document is not an option, Speakeasy also supports the [OpenAPI Overlays](/docs/prep-openapi/overlays/create-overlays) specification, which allows you to add or override parts of an OpenAPI document without modifying the original document.

This step can form part of your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that your SDKs are always up-to-date with your API, even if your OpenAPI document is generated from code.

Speakeasy's CLI can also generate OpenAPI overlays for you, based on the differences between two OpenAPI documents.

### SDK and Bundle Size

Let's compare the bundle sizes of the SDKs generated by Speakeasy and APIMatic.

Start by adding a `sdk-tests/speakeasy.ts` file that imports the Speakeasy SDK:

```typescript sdk-tests/speakeasy.ts
import { SDKCore } from "openapi/core.js";
import { booksAddBook } from "openapi/funcs/booksAddBook.js";

// Use `SDKCore` for best tree-shaking performance.
// You can create one instance of it to use across an application.
const sdk = new SDKCore({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
});

async function run() {
  const res = await booksAddBook(sdk, {
    id: 1,
    title: "New Sci-Fi Book",
    description: "A new Sci-Fi book description",
    category: "Sci-fi",
    price: 1999,
    author: {
      id: 1,
      name: "New Author",
      photo: "https://example.com/photos/newauthor.jpg",
      biography: "New Author is an upcoming writer in the Sci-Fi genre...",
    },
    coverImage: "https://example.com/covers/newbook.jpg",
  });

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw res.error;
  }

  const { value: result } = res;

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result)
}

run();
```

Next, add a `sdk-tests/apimatic.ts` file that imports the APIMatic SDK:

```typescript sdk-tests/apimatic.ts
import {
  Client,
  BooksController,
  AddBookBody,
  AddBookResponse,
  CategoryEnum,
  ApiError,
} from "bookstore-apilib";

const client = new Client({
  apiKeyCredentials: {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const booksController = new BooksController(client);

const body: AddBookBody = {
  title: "Clean Code",
  description: "A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
  price: 2999,
  category: CategoryEnum.Programming,
  author: {
    name: "Robert C. Martin",
    photo: "https://example.com/photos/robert.jpg",
    biography:
      'Robert Cecil Martin, colloquially known as "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer...',
  },
  id: 1,
  coverImage: "https://example.com/covers/cleancode.jpg",
};

async function addBook() {

  try {
    const { result, ...httpResponse } = await booksController.addBook(body);
    console.log(result);
    if (AddBookResponse.isProgrammingBook(result)) {
      // Use the result narrowed down to ProgrammingBook type.
    } else if (AddBookResponse.isFantasyBook(result)) {
      // Use the result narrowed down to FantasyBook type.
    } else if (AddBookResponse.isSciFiBook(result)) {
      // Use the result narrowed down to SciFiBook type.
    } else {
      // result is narrowed down to type 'never'.
    }
    // Get more response info...
    // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    if (error instanceof ApiError) {
      const errors = error.result;
    }
  }
}

addBook();
```

Running the code above generates a validation error, due to the lack of discriminated unions in the SDK generated by APIMatic. This won't affect the bundle size, though.

We'll use `esbuild` to bundle the SDKs. First, install `esbuild`:

```bash
npm install esbuild
```

Next, add a `sdk-tests/build.js` script that uses `esbuild` to bundle the SDKs:

```typescript sdk-tests/build.js
import * as esbuild from "esbuild";
import * as fs from "fs";

const speakeasyBuild = await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ["speakeasy.ts"],
  outfile: "dist/speakeasy.cjs",
  bundle: true,
  minify: true,
  treeShaking: true,
  metafile: true,
  target: "node18",
  platform: "node",
});

fs.writeFileSync(
  "dist/speakeasy.json",
  JSON.stringify(speakeasyBuild.metafile, null, 2)
);

const apimaticBuild = await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ["apimatic.ts"],
  outfile: "dist/apimatic.cjs",
  bundle: true,
  minify: true,
  treeShaking: true,
  metafile: true,
  target: "node18",
  platform: "node",
});

fs.writeFileSync(
  "dist/apimatic.json",
  JSON.stringify(apimaticBuild.metafile, null, 2)
);
```

Run the `build.js` script:

```bash
node build.ts
```

This generates two bundles, `dist/speakeasy.cjs` and `dist/apimatic.cjs`, along with their respective metafiles.

#### Bundle Size Comparison

Now that we have two bundles, let's compare their sizes.

First, let's look at the size of the `dist/speakeasy.cjs` bundle:

```bash
du -sh dist/speakeasy.cjs
# Output
# 128K    dist/speakeasy.cjs
```

Next, let's look at the size of the `dist/apimatic.cjs` bundle:

```bash
du -sh dist/apimatic.cjs
# Output
# 360K    dist/apimatic.cjs
```

Despite lacking runtime data validation, the bundle built with the SDK generated by APIMatic is significantly larger than that built with the SDK generated by Speakeasy.

We can use the metafiles generated by `esbuild` to analyze the bundle sizes in more detail.

#### Analyzing Bundle Sizes

The metafiles generated by `esbuild` contain detailed information about which source files contribute to each bundle's size, presented as a tree structure.

We used esbuild's online [bundle visualizer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/) to analyze the bundle sizes.

Here's a summary of the bundle sizes:

The `dist/speakeasy.cjs` bundle's largest contributor, at 43.4%, is the Zod library used for runtime data validation. The Zod library's tree-shaking capabilities are a work in progress, and future versions of SDKs are expected to have smaller bundle sizes.

The `dist/apimatic.cjs` bundle's largest contributor, at 37.4%, is `mime-db`, a "large database of mime types and information about them" ([mime-db on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-db)).

### Bundling for the Browser

Speakeasy SDKs are designed to work in a range of environments, including the browser. To bundle an SDK for the browser, you can use a tool like `esbuild` or `webpack`.

Here's an example of how to bundle the Speakeasy SDK for the browser using `esbuild`:

```bash
npx esbuild speakeasy.ts --bundle --minify --target=es2020 --platform=browser --outfile=dist/speakeasy.js
```

Doing the same for the APIMatic SDK generates an error, as the SDK is not designed to work in the browser out of the box.

```bash
npx esbuild apimatic.ts --bundle --minify --target=es2020 --platform=browser --outfile=dist/apimatic.js
# ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "stream"
```

## Linting and Change Detection

Speakeasy keeps track of changes in your OpenAPI document, and versions the SDKs it creates based on changes.
